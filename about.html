                <div class="about-body">
                    <p class="body-text">For my entire life, I've been a good one too. I did whatever my Shepherd told me to. I never dared to leave the pasture.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">Then, in March of 2020, a virus entered our food. My fellow sheep got sick. Our Shepherd locked us in our pens, told us to keep our distance, and didn’t let us graze.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">At first, I wasn’t worried. Our Shepherd brought us grass, water and gave us magical injections to keep us safe. “It’s only for two weeks and for your own protection,” he promised. We stayed inside and followed the rules.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">Months passed, and something didn’t feel right. The rules didn’t make sense anymore.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">The Shepherd was outside playing and drinking with other Shepherds, while we remained locked away. If someone let out even the slightest baaaaaaa, they’d be injected.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">The Shepherd could no longer be trusted. I began to wake up. Life was no longer about being safe, it was about being aware. I might always be a sheep, but I could still be free.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">So, when the Shepherd wasn’t looking, I made my escape. Now, I’m looking for other sheep like me. Join us and let’s take back the pasture from the evil Shepherds.</p>
